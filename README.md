# Helmet

Helmet is a neo-grotesque display typeface, currently with a single font.

Helmet is designed using the lesser-known open source font editor [Birdfont](https://birdfont.org/). Birdfont is far from perfect but has worked out all right for this single-font typeface.

**This is currently a WIP.** Use Helmet at your own risk.
