# Helmet

Helmet is a neo-grotesque display typeface, currently with a single font. It takes inspiration from Swiss classics like Helvetica and Univers but plays with proportions such as width and x-height to create a unique look and feel. Licensed under the [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL_web), the font is available for free both for personal and commercial use.

Helmet is designed in the open source font editor [Birdfont](https://birdfont.org/). Birdfont is far from perfect but has worked out all right for this single-font typeface.

Helmet Neue is a refined version of the typeface with cleaner glyph quality and an expanded character set. This version also includes a set of tabular and a set of old-style figures.
